**To develop your muscle memory, you will need to write more code.**
It takes more than a few hours to develop vi like editor muscle memory!

You can now choose what you will do during the rest of the workshop. You can:
- Keep going and extend nvim.
- Make a pause and train your muscle memory. I recommand using [exercism](https://exercism.org) and doing exercises in a language you have already used.

## Extend nvim

### Themes! Themes everywhere!

### Lsp code completion

### Snippets
