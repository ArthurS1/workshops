## It's a beginning

> 💡 You can also use vim but you will probably miss Lsp capability.
> There are plugins that do just that though!

### Installation

To install nvim, just use the package manager of your choice!
You will find more instructions [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).

### Tutorial time

**Step 1 - Vim tutor**
> - Do the vim tutorial. You can access it by typing `:Tutor` in nvim or on [openvim](https://www.openvim.com/) if you want a nice gui.
> - You can also use [vim-adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) but i do not recommand it cause I am so bad at this.
> - It takes about 30 minutes and will give you usefull (and sometimes less usefull) shortcuts to start with.

### Hello world!

**Step 2 - Write some code!**
> Use some C or another language you are familliar with and do the following function.
> - Given a string of characters as parameter
> - If it is an isogram return 0
> - Else return 1.

### Basic configuration

We will do basic configuration:

**Step 3 - Make it clean**
> - Map the `<esc>` key to a more reachable key if needed (i use `<²>`)
> - Make `(`, `[` and `{` autoclose without using plugins
> - Map the `<esc>` key to close escape terminal mode (try `:terminal` in normal mode)
> - Show line numbers, or better: show relative line numbers !
> - Move swap files to another default location (e.g `~/.config/nvim/tmp/`)
> - Make every tab 4 spaces
> - Setup fold methods

> 💡 `:help` is your best friend!

**Choose your path**
> 💡 **To develop your muscle memory, you will need to write more code.**
> It takes more than a few hours to develop vi like editor muscle memory!

> You can now choose what you will do during the rest of the workshop. You can:
> - Keep going and extend nvim.
> - Make a pause and train your muscle memory. I recommand using [exercism](https://exercism.org) and doing exercises in a language you have already used.
