## Installation

> âœ… Version required is **2.8** or superior. To check that do 
`blender --version` or `flatpak run org.blender.Blender --version`.

- Blender is open source so you should have it in the repositories of
your distribution of choice.
- Another way to get it is via flatpak on the 
[flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.blender.Blender) repository.
- If needed you can download the binary directly 
on [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/download/) and add it to your path.

### User interface

Let's begin by a few important facts on the user interface :

- Blender has a modular interface composed of multiple windows. They can be resized, reordered, added and deleted.

- They are themself arranged within workspaces in the top bar.

- You should also checkout the pannel settings,
you might find interesting stuff inside ðŸ˜‰.

> ðŸ’¡ The ui is quite complete and complex, a good way to discover it is 
[blender docs](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/).

### Moving around in the viewport

There are three controls you should know of :

- Rotate `middle click` or drag on the three axis on the top right corner of the viewport.

More tips:

- The coordinates in blender are expressed in X, Y and Z (up) - 
It's not the case in all software !
- You should checkout orthographic and normal view, can be usefull sometimes.
